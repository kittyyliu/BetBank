# Criminal Record Management System Project

## What will the application do?

    The application will keep track of a list of criminals and their criminal record. It will let every 
    police officer know when a criminal is released and also keeps track of different reports coming in

The following information will be kept track of by the application:
- Full name
- Gender
- Age
- Nationality
- Type of offense
- Case Number
- Jail term

## Who will use it?
    It will be used by law enforcement/police officers. There will be an admin login option for police officers 
    to add criminals or edit criminal profiles

## Why is this project of interest to me?
    Before wanting to go into computer science, I was always extremely interested in true crime and law enforcement. 
    To this day, I still start every morning and end every day by listening to true crime podcasts. I am fascinated 
    by anything crime related, and this project directly dives into the management system for criminals.
