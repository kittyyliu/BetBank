# BetBank Project

## What will the application do?

    The application is meant to simulate a banking app, allowing users to check their account balance, deposit money,
    or withdraw money. Instead of it being for a regular bank account, it will be an account solely used for online 
    sports betting with "fake money" or credits.

The following information will be kept track of by the application:

- Account balance
- Deposits
- Bets
- Previous transactions

## Who will use it?
    It will be used by users aged 19+ who have a want to do sports betting without the risk of losing real money

## Why is this project of interest to me?
    With the changes that COVID has brought, I have realized an increasing popularity in online gambling, espcially
    online sports betting. I have many friends who have gotten really into sports betting recently and as a result
    have lost a substantial amount of money. With this credit system, they will be able to keep track of how well their
    bets are doing and have fun without losing real money.
